# Dark-theme-Material-Design
To set Dark and Light theme using android
The dark mode is a feature that allows you to switch the color theme of an app or a whole OS to black or something on the brink of it. Beyond the joys of invigorating a tired design, one may wish to choose because it makes watching the device screen way more comfortable and relaxing on the eyes. Typical pixel values during the regular mode fall between 200 to 255. Each pixel emitting light at 255 value corresponds to the maximum possible light it can emit, providing more power. Similarly, a 0 value corresponds to the minimum amount, which corresponds to no power being supplied to the pixel. If one uses a smartphone that has an OLED display and enables dark mode, it might save some battery life too. So it becomes essential for a developer to add such a feature in the desired application. This article wants to share with you the implementation of dark mode in Android by using available libraries. Dark Mode is an example of optimization of User Experience as well as the Battery. It can be implemented on any application a developer desires. A sample GIF is given below to get an idea about what we are going to do in this article. Note that we are going to implement this project using the Kotlin language.
